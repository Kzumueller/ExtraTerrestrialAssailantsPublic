# Extraterrestrial Assailants
totally not a clone

## Building & execution
To run/test/debug this application using IntelliJ, simply navigate to 
`com.zumueller.extraterrestrialassailants.desktop.DesktopLauncherKt`
and run the main function there.  

To build and run without an IDE, use `gradlew run`.  

To generate a self-sufficient `.jar` for sharing, use `gradlew dist` and look for the newly built
artifact in `/desktop/build/libs/` or configure gradle to put it someplace else.

## Controls

Use `A` / `D` for horizontal movement and `Space` to fire away!
